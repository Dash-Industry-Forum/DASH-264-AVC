# Introduction # {#chapter-introduction}
This document defines DASH-IF's InterOperability Points (IOPs). The document includes IOPs for only this version of the document. For earlier versions, please refer to version 1 [1] and version 2 [2] of this document. DASH-IF recommends to deprecate the IOPs in previous versions and deploy using one of the IOPs and extensions in this document.

As a historical note, the scope of the initial DASH-AVC/264 IOP, issued with version 1 of this document [1] was the basic support high-quality video distribution over the top. Both live and on-demand services are supported.

In the second version of this document [2], HD video (up to 1080p) extensions and several mul-tichannel audio extensions are defined.

In this third version of the DASH-IF IOP document, two new DASH-264/AVC IOPs are defined. Detailed refinements and improvements for DASH-IF live services and for ad insertion were added in these IOPs. One of these IOP is the superset of the simpler one. Additionally, two cor-responding IOPs are defined to also support HEVC [19]. In both cases, AVC and HEVC, the more advanced IOP adds additional requirements on the DASH client to support segment pars-ing to achieve enhancement of live services. This structuring separates the Media Profiles from DASH features.

In the fourth version, beyond minor improvements, corrections and alignment with MPEG-DASH third edition, the key additions are extensions for next generation audio and UHD/HDR video.

This document defines the IOPs in Table 1 and Extensions in Table 2. The Implementation Guidelineâ€™s version in which each IOP or Extension was added is also provided in the tables.

Note that all version 1 IOPs are also defined in version 2 and therefore referencing version [2] is sufficient.

In addition to the Interoperability points in Table 1 and extensions in Table 2, this document also defines several other identifiers and other interoperability values for functional purposes as documented in Table 3.

DASH-IF supports these guidelines with test and conformance tools:
* DASH-IF conformance software is available for use online at http://dashif.org/conformance.html [32]. The software is based on an open-source code. The frontend source code and documentation is available at: https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/Conformance-Software. The backend source code is available at: https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/Conformance-and-reference-source.
* DASH-IF test assets (features, test cases, test vectors) along with the documentation are available at http://testassets.dashif.org [31]. 
* DASH Identifiers for different categories can be found at http://dashif.org/identifiers/ [33]. DASH-IF supporters are encouraged that external identifiers are submitted for doc-umentation there as well. Note also that DASH-IF typically tries to avoid defining iden-tifiers. Identifiers in italics are subject to discussion with other organizations and may be deprecated in a later version. 

Technologies included in this document and for which no test and conformance material is provided, are only published as a candidate technology and may be removed if no test material is provided before releasing a new version of this guidelines document.
